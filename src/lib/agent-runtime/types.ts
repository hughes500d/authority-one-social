// AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE: pilot-agent-runtime/APP-CHANNEL.md. The runtime speaks two
// shapes from the SAME route:
//
//   SSE (Accept: text/event-stream) — the event NAME is on the SSE `event:` line and
//   the `data:` line is a bare JSON object WITHOUT a `type` field:
//       event: chunk
//       data: {"delta":"First sentence. "}
//       event: done
//       data: {"message":"…full reply…","status":"drafted","pending":[…],"mediaUrls":[]}
//
//   JSON (default) — one object: {message, status, pending, mediaUrls}.
//
// NB: an earlier version of this file ASSUMED each `data:` line carried its own
// `{type:'text'|'done'|…}` discriminator. The runtime never sends that, which is why
// the parser matched nothing and the assistant bubble rendered empty. Keyed on the
// `event:` name now.
